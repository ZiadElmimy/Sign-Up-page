# Sign Up page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### In HTML
- I created the form to get the inputs from users using different types of inputs:
  - textbox
  - email
  - password
  - tel 
  - date
  - radio buttons
  - checkbox
- Customize them with properties to specify if any of them is required and so on

### In CSS
- I styled the elements built and add some classes to be selected and added to the exist one to apply some styling in specific suitations.

### In JavaScript
- I add the functionality to the elements, and that by selecting them and add event listener to the submit button to check 
the info entered by the user, and accepts the user data only of everything is ok and the agreement checkbox is checked, and print them to the console
to make sure that the data is stored in the local storage
- Check the password and password confirmation matching and show an indicator to the user
if they aren't the same with a specific class styling after adding it to the exist one
- Check of the agreement checkbox is check or not, and if not indicate the user that it's not checked 
- Return the form fields to their default states to receive new user data after storing the entered ones in the local storage.
